BOUT++ is a framework for writing fluid and plasma simulations in
curvilinear geometry. It is intended to be quite modular, with a
variety of numerical methods and time-integration solvers
available. BOUT++ is primarily designed and tested with reduced plasma
fluid models in mind, but it can evolve any number of equations, with
equations appearing in a readable form.

Jointly developed by University of York (UK), LLNL, CCFE, DCU, DTU,
and other international partners.

## Requirements

BOUT++ needs the following:

* A C++11 compiler
* MPI
* FFTW3
* Either NetCDF or HDF5

Note that some of the tests require NetCDF rather than HDF5

BOUT++ has the following optional dependencies:

* OpenMP
* PETSc
* SLEPc
* ARKODE
* IDA
* CVODE
* MUMPS
* LAPACK
* Score-p (for performance diagnostics)

## Usage and installation
Please see the [users manual](http://bout-dev.readthedocs.io)
